# fastauc

## Installation

Install in development mode:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

The `-e` option means "editable", so no need to reinstall package everytime the source code is modified.

## Testing

Run a small test to compare results and performance between `fastauc` and `scikit-learn`

```bash
$ python test.py
```
